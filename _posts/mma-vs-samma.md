**Samma** incorporates a unique set of kicking techniques designed not just for the ring, but for real-world self-defense. Unlike traditional martial arts that focus on sport-based limitations, Samma takes a hybrid approach—merging the power of Muay Thai, the precision of Karate, and the fluidity of Taekwondo.

**Kicks Built for Combat**
💥 Oblique Kick: The secret weapon in street fights—targeting the opponent’s knee, instantly destabilizing their stance.
🔥 Side Kick: A long-range powerhouse that creates space and delivers a devastating blow to the ribs or head.
⚡ Spinning Hook Kick: Not just for flash—proper execution means an opponent never sees it coming.
🥋 Low Calf Kick: Popularized in modern MMA, but Samma uses it strategically to cripple mobility fast.

**Street Scenarios & Tactical Use**

**🚶 Situation 1: A Sudden Attack in a Narrow Alley**
In confined spaces, a front kick to the midsection pushes an attacker back, buying time to escape. If they persist, a sharp low calf kick can leave them unable to chase.

**🏙️ Situation 2: Confrontation with Multiple Opponents**
Samma fighters are trained to use angles—instead of squaring up, pivoting after each strike prevents being surrounded. The spinning hook kick in this scenario isn’t just flashy—it’s a game-changer when properly placed.

**🏠 Situation 3: Home Invasion Defense**
A sidekick to the intruder’s knee is enough to end the fight before it starts. Unlike traditional martial arts that emphasize formal stances, Samma’s techniques work from any position, even when caught off guard.

## #MMA is built for rules and rounds. Samma is built for real fights.
